# Severance MDR Console

A Flutter-based cross-platform console UI inspired by the **Severance** series, designed to simulate Macro Data Refinement (MDR) operations in a dark, minimal, corporate-styled environment.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The Severance MDR Console is a fictional productivity console built using Flutter, targeting desktop (Windows, macOS) and web. It allows users to engage with dynamic data bins, animated numeric inputs, and a stylized user experience that mirrors the eerie but structured world of Severance.

This is a UI/UX concept app for creative exploration and experimentation.

### 🖱️ Custom Cursor Implementation

#### Web (index.html)

For the Web version of the Severance MDR Console, a custom cursor is applied using the following CSS in index.html:
```css
html, body {
  cursor: url("./assets/mdr-cursor.png") 16 16, auto;
}
```

This ensures that when users interact with the page, they experience the custom cursor styled for the application.

#### macOS

On macOS, a custom cursor is set using a Flutter macOS plugin written in Swift. The custom cursor changes whenever the mouse moves over the application window, giving the interface a unified and engaging look. The following Swift code is used in AppDelegate.swift:

```swift
import Cocoa
import FlutterMacOS

@main
class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
  override func applicationDidFinishLaunching(_ notification: Notification) {
    // Set the custom cursor here
    setCustomCursor(imageName: "mdr-cursor.png")
    return super.applicationDidFinishLaunching(notification)
  }

  func setCustomCursor(imageName: String) {
    if let fullPath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: imageName, ofType: nil),
       let image = NSImage(contentsOfFile: fullPath) {

      let cursor = NSCursor(image: image, hotSpot: NSPoint(x: image.size.width / 2, y: image.size.height / 2))
      cursor.set()

      // Optionally re-apply the cursor on movement
      NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents(matching: .mouseMoved) { event in
        cursor.set()
        return event
      }

      NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents(matching: .mouseMoved) { _ in
        cursor.set()
      }

    } else {
      print("Cursor image not found: \(imageName)")
    }
  }
}
```

This code ensures that the custom cursor is set when the app launches on macOS, providing a seamless user experience similar to the Web version.
